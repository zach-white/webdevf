                    <em>To Whom This May Concern</em>,<br><br>
                    I am a <strong>Software Engineering Student</strong> with hands-on experience in developing software, team management, and training.
                    My combination of skills has allowed me to excel in many different industries which I have thrived in while attending Western Governors University.
                    I have over-hauled employee procedures, decreased new-hire ramp up time and through training, taught the value of time management and urgency.

                    My Software Engineering Internship gave me most of my programming experience.
                    I was paired along side of a Senior Software Engineer where I was mentored with great care and taught modern programming practices.
                    With their mentorship and my urgency and drive, I was able to expand on a project that is in production and increase the efficiency of a feature by 20%.
                    My leadership and training background comes from my previous positions as a Night Club Manager and a Dispatcher. 
                    After excelling in initial training myself and thriving at my duties, I was promoted and given full reins to do what it took to get direct reports on the same metrics as myself.
                    This involved crafting a program at my NightClub Management job to make procedure completion as easy as possible. 
                    Doing so increased my direct reports speed, efficiency and urgency which resulted in a better experience for other bar staff employees and patrons.
